nodegoat ([nodegoat.net](https://nodegoat.net)) is a web-based data management, network analysis & visualisation environment.

Using nodegoat, you can create and manage any number of datasets by use of a graphic user interface. Your own data model autoconfigures the backbone of nodegoat's core functionalities.

nodegoat is conceptualised and developed by [LAB1100](https://lab1100.com).

## Installation

nodegoat runs on [1100CC](https://lab1100.com/1100cc), make sure you have an 1100CC installation running first.

Follow the steps in the [SETUP](SETUP.md) file.

Check and follow the steps in the [UPDATE](UPDATE.md) file when updating from an existing installation, and check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) to see what has changed.

## Partners

Work on nodegoat started in 2011 thanks to Joep Leerssen. His [Study Platform on Interlocking Nationalisms](https://spinnet.eu/) (University of Amsterdam) has supported the development of nodegoat ever since. The [Repertorium Academicum Germanicum](https://rag-online.org) (Universit√§t Bern), and Susanna de Beer (Leiden University) also supported the development of nodegoat throughout the years.

nodegoat would not be possible and brought to its current level without the support from the many research projects that run and support nodegoat, see the [nodegoat About](https://nodegoat.net/about) page. 

Thanks to all the users at nodegoat.net, especially those who joined nodegoat from the start (check out the [nodegoat Use Cases](https://nodegoat.net/usecases)!).
